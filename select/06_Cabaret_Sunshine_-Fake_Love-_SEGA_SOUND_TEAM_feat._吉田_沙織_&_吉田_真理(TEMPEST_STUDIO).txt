How can I smile to men I got no feeling
I realized that I lost every things women should feel
Dressed up like fashion doll,
Lip in red and gave fake love for fill up their sorrow hearts
(Give me love) where is love
(Could I love you) love fade away
(Give me love) where is love
(Could I love you) fade away
(What is love)
(Fake love) Where is my love
(Fake love) I cannot find it
(Fake love) If I walk through that big door,
(Fake love) can I find love I lost
(Fake love) Tonight I'm gonna smile again for you
(Fake love) as you like it baby
(Fake love) give me love
(Fake love) gone away
(Someone tell me, how can I smile)
(My love, my everything)
