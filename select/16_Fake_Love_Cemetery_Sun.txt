My head is spinning in a dark room
You caught me staring at the ceiling
This is the setting of the seasons
I'll use the cross-eyed thoughts to

Excuse myself, amuse myself
And lose myself until we come back down
To prove that hell is where my heart's been
Run in circles 'til we come back down

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

I'm falling down your stairwell
Eyes are closing if you can't tell
Me the rhyme in all your reasons
'Cause it's the setting of the seasons

So excuse yourself, amuse yourself
And lose yourself until we come back down
To prove that hell is where your hearts been
Run in circles 'til we come back down

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

It's in the bedroom, in the basement
From your head down to your heart
Every flame that you spark
In the light and in the dark
Makes a mark that they see
No impossibility, it's the air that we breathe
And the thoughts that we think

Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

(Collaboration)
Makes one hell of a collaboration

Tonight we're slaving to another beat
Come on, baby, take a back seat
Hard drugs, fake love; it's a sensation
Makes one hell of a collaboration

(Collaboration)
Makes one hell of a collaboration
